# CIS 131-102 Final Project

Final Project – Angular Movie / Tv  Database

Using the Angular Framework we have been working with the past few weeks,  AND the Movie Database we have been using for our api - create a web application that:

    The Home page should be a component which displays two cards – one with a current movie and one with a current tv show.
    Clicking on the movie will link the user to a component which will display a minimum of 6 movies from the now_playing api
        Display each movie’s title, picture, release date, and description
    Clicking on the tv card will link the user to a component which will display a minimum of 6 tv shows from the TV/Get Popular api
        Display each tv show’s name, first air date, picture and description
    Navigation should appear across all pages but should only be in a single template (not hardcoded in several different components)
        Includes a link to Home | Movies | TvShows

Your application must demonstrate the use of:

    TypeScript
    Components
    Routing
    HttpClientModule to get your api request
    Interfaces for the movie and the tv shows (at least one)
    Push your solution to gitHub. Be sure to incorporate .gitignore so your node_modules and unnecessary files are NOT also pushed.
        Make sure your repo is public so I can see it
